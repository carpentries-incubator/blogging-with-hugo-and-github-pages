## Preparing to Teach

If you already host your own website using GitHub Pages and have a `USERNAME.github.io` repository, you may want to create a "dummy" GitHub user or create the repo under a GitHub organisation so as to not interfere with your own website.
Make sure to invite your _real_ account to collaborate on the repo so that you don't have to change your local git config to push/pull to the repo.
